New_travel666.pde is the main code file. 
Geomarkers.pde has all the markers that are marking a location.

Places.pde has all the places that the person visited.

This is an interactive processing project which is using the library of unfolding maps. In this the coordinates of the places my friend visited are being read from a csv file and then these locations are being marked using the inbuilt markers of processing. 

The animation is created when we click on these markers and pictures are displayed when we click on them
